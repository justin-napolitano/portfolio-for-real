# USSupremeCourtMetaDataGraph: Technical Overview and Implementation Notes

## Motivation and Problem Statement

The US Supreme Court produces a vast corpus of jurisprudence essential for legal and political analysis. However, accessing and analyzing metadata for all cases in a structured, scalable way is non-trivial. The Library of Congress provides an API exposing case metadata, but this data is paginated, nested, and not directly modeled for network analysis.

This project addresses the challenge of programmatically extracting, cleaning, and structuring metadata for every US Supreme Court case available in the Library of Congress database. The goal is to convert this metadata into a graph format amenable to political science research, enabling analysis of relationships between cases, justices, topics, and other entities.

## How the Project is Built

The core components are Python scripts organized under `active_code_base/`. The main scraper classes (`search_results_page`, `search_collections`) construct URLs to query the Library of Congress API, handle HTTP requests with appropriate headers, and parse JSON responses.

Pagination is handled by iterating over pages with a configurable number of results per page (e.g., 150). Responses are parsed into JSON objects, and relevant metadata fields are extracted.

The project uses `networkx` to create graph representations from the flattened JSON metadata. Flattening is performed with the `flatten_json` library, allowing nested structures to be converted into key-value pairs suitable for node and edge creation.

Data cleaning utilities (`clean_loc_data.py`) process raw JSON files, extracting relevant 'results' arrays and dumping cleaned JSON files for downstream use.

Configuration is managed via YAML files (`config.yaml`) containing Google Sheet IDs and other parameters, suggesting integration with Google APIs for data input or output.

Testing is implemented using pytest, with tests validating credential creation, config loading, and scraper output correctness.

## Implementation Details and Considerations

- The scraper respects API usage by setting user-agent headers and encoding requests properly.
- Classes like `search_results_page` encapsulate URL creation, data fetching, and JSON parsing.
- The project contains multiple iterations of scraper scripts (`loc_scraper_1.py`, `loc_scraper_2.py`, `loc_scraper_3.py`), indicating ongoing refinement.
- The graph construction is in early stages, with placeholder classes like `node_json` hinting at node generation from JSON keys.
- Output JSON files are organized by page number and stored in directories like `output_2/` and `cleaned_output/`.
- The project uses Google API client libraries, likely for authentication and interaction with Google Sheets or Drive.
- Visualization dependencies (`matplotlib`) are imported but not fully integrated, suggesting future graph plotting features.
- Rate limiting and error handling are mentioned but not fully implemented.

## Practical Notes for Returning Developers

- Start by reviewing `active_code_base/loc_scraper_1.py` and `clean_loc_data.py` for the core scraping and cleaning logic.
- Configuration parameters and credentials must be set in `config.yaml` and appropriate JSON credential files.
- The scraping process can be resource-intensive and lengthy due to the number of pages; consider implementing or enabling rate limiting.
- The graph data model is not fully defined; extending `node_json` and integrating with a graph database like JanusGraph is planned.
- Tests in `tests/` provide examples of usage and validation; running them can help verify environment setup.
- Output JSON files contain rich metadata fields such as contributors, dates, call numbers, and links, which can be mapped into graph nodes and edges.
- Dockerization and deployment scripts are forthcoming; currently, the environment requires manual setup.

## Summary

This project is a technical foundation for mining and analyzing US Supreme Court case metadata from the Library of Congress. It combines web scraping, JSON processing, and graph data modeling to facilitate political and legal research. While incomplete, it provides a structured approach and codebase for further development and integration with graph databases and visualization tools.
