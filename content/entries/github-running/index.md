This repository contains personal reflections and goals related to running, focusing on improving technique and physical awareness. It is a collection of notes rather than a software project.

## Features

- Documented personal running goals and observations
- Focus on breathing, injury prevention, balance, and terrain adaptation

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for content
- Static content, no programming language or framework involved

## Getting Started

Since this repository is a personal note collection in Markdown, there are no installation or runtime requirements. You can view the content directly on GitHub or clone the repository to read locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/running.git
cd running
# Open index.md in your preferred Markdown viewer or editor
```

## Project Structure

```
/index.md         # Main document containing running goals and reflections
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand documentation with more detailed running logs or data
- Integrate with a static site generator for better presentation
- Add analysis or tracking tools if the project evolves into a software application

This repository currently serves as a personal journal and may be expanded or repurposed in the future.
