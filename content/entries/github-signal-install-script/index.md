A shell script to automate the installation of Signal Desktop on 64-bit Debian-based Linux systems such as Ubuntu and Mint. This script handles the addition of the official Signal repository and installs the application with minimal user intervention.

---

## Features

- Installs the official Signal public software signing key.
- Adds the Signal repository to the system's package sources.
- Updates the package database and installs Signal Desktop.
- Designed for Debian-based distributions (64-bit).

## Tech Stack

- Shell scripting (Bash)
- Debian package management tools (`apt`, `wget`, `gpg`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 64-bit Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Mint)
- Administrative privileges (sudo)

### Installation

1. Save the installation script to a file, for example `install_signal.sh`.

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x install_signal.sh
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./install_signal.sh
```

The script will perform the following:

- Download and install the Signal public key.
- Add the Signal repository to your system.
- Update your package list.
- Install Signal Desktop.

## Project Structure

```
signal-install-script/
├── install-signal.sh           # Main installation script
├── signal-desktop-keyring.gpg  # Signal public keyring file (generated by script)
├── readme.md                   # Documentation file (this README)
└── index.md                    # Additional project documentation
```

*Note: `signal-desktop-keyring.gpg` is generated during script execution and can be ignored or removed.*

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add support for additional Debian-based distributions and architectures.
- Implement verification of existing Signal installations to prevent redundant installs.
- Add options for uninstalling or upgrading Signal Desktop.
- Improve error handling and logging within the script.
- Containerize the installation process for reproducible environments.
