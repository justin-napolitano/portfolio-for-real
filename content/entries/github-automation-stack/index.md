Compose wiring for a personal automation stack integrating Signal messaging, an assistant core, and skill-based microservices.

## Features

- Signal messaging integration using signal-cli REST API
- Notifier gateway to send and receive Signal messages securely
- Assistant core built on FastAPI with LangChain/LlamaIndex for AI-powered automation
- Modular skill services (e.g., weather service) with cron scheduling and webhook support
- Docker Compose setup for easy local deployment and development
- Secure token-based authentication and sender allowlists

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- FastAPI for API services
- signal-cli-rest-api Docker image for Signal messaging
- LangChain / LlamaIndex for AI assistant capabilities
- Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration
- Flask for notifier-gateway microservice

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Clone this repo alongside `assistant-core` and `weather-service` repos

### Installation & Run

```bash
# Copy environment template and edit
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to configure phone numbers, tokens, API keys, etc.

# Start all services
docker compose up -d --build

# Verify services
curl http://localhost:8088/status  # assistant-core status
curl http://localhost:8789/run      # weather-service run endpoint
curl http://localhost:8787/healthz  # notifier-gateway health
```

```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add more skill containers (metrics, reminders, etc.)
- Improve assistant-core with additional AI models and retrieval-augmented generation
- Enhance security with more granular sender whitelisting and token management
- Add observability features such as centralized logging and metrics
- Support multi-replica deployments with leader election for polling
- Refactor legacy weather-service and unify skill APIs
