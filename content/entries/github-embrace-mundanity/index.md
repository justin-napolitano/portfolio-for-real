A reflective personal project exploring the challenges and realities of daily life routines and mental well-being. This repository contains a written piece discussing the difficulty of maintaining everyday tasks and the tension between ideal and actual habits.

---

## Features

- Personal narrative on daily routines and mental health struggles
- Structured sections outlining current habits, ideal routines, and reflections
- Markdown format suitable for static site generation or personal journaling

## Tech Stack

- Markdown content (index.md)
- Presumably static site generator compatible (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll) based on frontmatter format

## Getting Started

This repository contains primarily markdown content. To view or edit:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/embrace_mundanity.git
cd embrace_mundanity
```

2. Open `index.md` in any markdown editor or viewer.

3. (Optional) Use a static site generator to render the markdown into a website.

## Project Structure

```
embrace_mundanity/
└── index.md       # Main content file with personal reflections and routines
```

The `index.md` file contains frontmatter metadata for title, description, author, tags, images, date, and categories.

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand content with more detailed reflections or additional daily routines
- Add support for multiple posts or entries to track progress over time
- Integrate with a static site generator for better presentation
- Include automation to track or visualize routines

*Note: The repository currently contains a single markdown file with personal reflections. No code or executable components are present.*
