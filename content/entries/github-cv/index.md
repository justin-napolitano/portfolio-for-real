This repository contains the source and build files for my personal CV website hosted at [cv.jnapolitano.io](https://cv.jnapolitano.io). It is built primarily using HTML and Sphinx documentation tools, with automated deployment and backup scripts.

## Features

- Static HTML generation of personal CV and related documentation
- Automated build and deployment scripts using Makefile and shell scripts
- Dropbox backup integration for HTML builds
- Sphinx-based documentation with support for blog posts, machine learning projects, and data projects
- TensorFlow machine learning projects integrated as submodules

## Tech Stack

- HTML for the CV website
- Python 3.5+ for build automation and Dropbox API integration
- Sphinx documentation generator with extensions such as ablog, myst_nb, sphinx_copybutton
- TensorFlow for machine learning projects
- Bash shell scripts for deployment and maintenance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 or higher
- pip package manager
- Dropbox SDK for Python (`pip install dropbox`)
- GitHub CLI for deployment (`ghp-import` tool)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/cv.git
cd cv
```

2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Setup Dropbox access token in `backup_html.py` for backup functionality.

### Build and Deploy

- To build the HTML documentation:

```bash
make html
```

- To deploy the built HTML to GitHub Pages:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

- To backup the HTML build to Dropbox:

```bash
python backup_html.py
```

```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Clean up and consolidate shell scripts for clarity and purpose
- Improve configuration management and environment variable handling
- Enhance documentation structure and add more detailed usage guides
- Expand Dropbox backup functionality with error handling and logging
- Modularize machine learning projects for easier reuse
- Automate testing and continuous integration for builds and deployments
