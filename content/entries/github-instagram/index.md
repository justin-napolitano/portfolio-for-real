This repository contains a personal reflection on the use and impact of Instagram. It is not a software project but rather a documented introspection on social media usage, addiction, and alternative activities.

## Features

- Personal narrative on Instagram usage
- Discussion of social connection and addiction
- Exploration of alternatives like chess and go

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for documentation
- Static content (index.md)

## Getting Started

Since this repository contains a markdown file with reflections, no installation or runtime environment is necessary. You can view the content directly on GitHub or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/instagram.git
cd instagram
# Open index.md with any markdown viewer or text editor
```

## Project Structure

```
instagram/
└── index.md    # Main reflection document
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand reflections with additional posts or topics
- Convert reflections into a blog or website format
- Add analysis or data on social media usage patterns
- Explore technical tools to monitor or limit social media use
