# jnapolitano.com: Technical Overview and Implementation Notes

## Motivation

The project is a personal website built to host a variety of content types: long-form blog posts, a lightweight journal, and a curated portfolio of projects. The motivation is to maintain a static, version-controlled, and easily deployable platform that can be updated with Markdown content and automatically published.

## Problem Addressed

Maintaining a personal site that supports multiple content types and frequent updates without manual deployment overhead. The project solves the problem of content management, site generation, and deployment automation in a streamlined manner.

## Architecture and Build Process

The site uses Hugo, a static site generator, specifically the Extended version, which supports advanced features like SCSS processing. Content is authored in Markdown, organized under the `content/` directory with subfolders for posts, journal entries, and portfolio items.

Archetypes provide templated front matter and structure for new content, facilitating consistency and speed in content creation.

The build process can be run locally with Hugo's development server, which supports live reload and preview of drafts and future-dated content. For production, a Docker container encapsulates the build environment, removing the need for local Hugo installation. The Dockerfile builds the site and serves the generated static files with Nginx.

## Continuous Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow is configured to trigger on pushes to `main` or `gh-pages` branches. It uses the same Hugo version as the Docker image to build the site and deploys the `public/` directory to GitHub Pages. This ensures that the live site is always up to date with the repository content.

## Content Structure

- `content/posts/`: Primary long-form blog posts
- `content/journal/`: Shorter, frequent notes and updates
- `content/portfolio/`: Highlighted projects with metadata

Each content type has an archetype in `archetypes/` to scaffold new entries with appropriate front matter.

## Implementation Details

- The site is configured via `config.toml` and `hugo.toml` files.
- Themes and layouts are organized under `themes/` and `layouts/` respectively.
- Static assets like images and CSS are managed in `static/` and `assets/`.
- The `public/` directory contains the generated static site, which is the deployment target.
- The repository includes scripts such as `submodule.sh` for managing Git submodules (likely for themes or content).

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules.
2. Use Hugo server locally for development with drafts and future content enabled.
3. Build and test the site in Docker for production parity.
4. Commit and push changes to trigger GitHub Actions deployment.

## Observations

- The repository contains a rich archive of blog posts with detailed front matter and varied content, indicating active personal use.
- The Docker workflow abstracts away local environment dependencies.
- The GitHub Actions workflow automates deployment, reducing manual intervention.

## Practical Notes

- Ensure Hugo Extended is installed locally for development or rely on Docker for build consistency.
- Keep submodules updated to maintain theme and content dependencies.
- Use archetypes to maintain front matter consistency.
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow logs for build or deployment errors.

## Summary

This project exemplifies a practical static site deployment pipeline leveraging Hugo, Docker, and GitHub Actions. It balances ease of content creation with automation and deployment best practices, suitable for personal blogging and portfolio hosting.
