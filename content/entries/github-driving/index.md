This repository contains a conceptual exploration and procedural outline regarding driving safety and efficiency, framed as a "win-set" of goals and actions. It captures the author's personal framework for navigating the complexities of driving with an emphasis on minimizing risk, legal compliance, and vehicle preservation.

## Features

- Clear articulation of driving goals and constraints
- Structured approach to risk avoidance and legal adherence
- Consideration of environmental context and temporal factors

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for documentation and conceptual modeling

## Getting Started

This repository primarily contains documentation and conceptual notes. To view the content:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/driving.git

# Open the index.md file in a Markdown viewer or editor
code driving/index.md  # or any Markdown viewer
```

## Project Structure

```
/index.md  # Main document outlining the driving win-set concept
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand documentation to include additional dimensions of driving safety and efficiency
- Develop practical tools or code implementations based on the conceptual framework
- Incorporate sensor data or environmental modeling for predictive driving assistance
- Formalize the temporal constraints and decision-making processes
