Analysis of global shipping patterns and data.

## Features

- Comprehensive analysis of global shipping data
- Data-driven insights into shipping trends and logistics
- Modular and extensible structure for future data sources and analyses

## Tech Stack

- Primary language: Assumed Python or R (common for data analysis)
- Data processing and visualization libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, or ggplot2)
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x or R installed (depending on implementation)
- Required packages/libraries (to be defined in requirements.txt or DESCRIPTION file)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/Shipping.git
cd Shipping

# Install dependencies (assuming Python)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis

```bash
# Run the main analysis script (assumed)
python main.py
```
