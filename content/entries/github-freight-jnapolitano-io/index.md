freight.jnapolitano.io is a data-driven project focused on analyzing United States freight networks, including rail, shipping, and intermodal freight transport. The repository contains Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and documentation to support the exploration and visualization of freight infrastructure.

---

## Features

- Analysis and visualization of US freight networks, including rail, shipping routes, and intermodal facilities
- Data processing and GIS mapping using geopandas, folium, and contextily
- Automated build and deployment scripts for generating and publishing documentation
- Backup and deployment automation via Dropbox API and GitHub Pages

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.5+ with libraries: pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, folium, contextily
- Jupyter Notebooks with MyST markdown support
- Sphinx documentation with extensions including ablog, myst_nb, sphinx_copybutton
- Bash scripts for deployment and backup
- Makefile for build automation

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 or higher
- pip package manager
- Dropbox account and API token (for backup script)
- GitHub CLI (for deployment script)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/freight.jnapolitano.io.git
cd freight.jnapolitano.io
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

- To build the HTML documentation:

```bash
make html
```

- To deploy the built documentation to GitHub Pages:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

- To backup the HTML build folder to Dropbox:

```bash
python backup_html.py
```
