A Python utility library providing reusable clients for Google Cloud Platform services including BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Cloud Logging, and Secret Manager. Designed to streamline development by consolidating common GCP client code into a single submodule.

---

## Features

- **BigQueryClient**: Simplifies dataset creation and table existence checks.
- **GCSClient**: Manage Google Cloud Storage buckets, list buckets, and create new buckets.
- **GoogleCloudLogging**: Setup and send logs to Google Cloud Logging with configurable severity.
- **GoogleSecretManager**: Access secrets securely from Google Secret Manager.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Google Cloud Client Libraries:
  - `google-cloud-bigquery`
  - `google-cloud-storage`
  - `google-cloud-logging`
  - `google-cloud-secret-manager`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated

### Installation

Clone the repository as a Git submodule in your project:

```bash
git submodule add -b pit https://github.com/justin-napolitano/gcputils.git
```

Install required Google Cloud libraries:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-storage google-cloud-bigquery google-cloud-logging google-cloud-secret-manager
```

### Usage

Import and initialize clients in your Python code. Example for Google Cloud Storage:

```python
from gcputils.gcpclient import GCSClient

project_id = 'your-gcp-project-id'
gcs_client = GCSClient(project_id, credentials_path='path/to/credentials.json')

buckets = gcs_client.list_buckets()
print(buckets)
```

Refer to each client class for available methods.

```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Complete implementation and testing of BigQueryClient methods.
- Add support for additional GCP services.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
- Provide more comprehensive usage examples and documentation.
- Automate deployment and CI/CD integration.
