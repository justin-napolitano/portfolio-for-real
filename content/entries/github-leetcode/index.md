LeetCode Answers repository contains Python solutions to a variety of common algorithmic problems frequently encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming. The repository is structured to provide clear, concise implementations of popular problems.

## Features

- Solutions to classic algorithmic problems such as Two Sum, Add Two Numbers (linked list), Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Binary Search Median, Merge Intervals, and Quick Sort.
- Both iterative and divide-and-conquer approaches for median finding.
- Clean, readable Python code with explanatory comments.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/LeetCode.git
cd LeetCode
```

### Running Solutions

Each problem solution is implemented in its own Python file. You can run them directly using Python. For example, to run the binary search median example:

```bash
python q4_binary_search_median.py
```

Note: Some files contain classes and methods that require you to instantiate the class or call methods with appropriate inputs.

## Project Structure

- `q1_two_sum.py`: Solution for the Two Sum problem.
- `q2_add_two_numbers_singly_linked_list.py`: Adds two numbers represented by singly linked lists.
- `q3_longest_substring.py`: Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- `q4_binary_search_median.py`: Median of two sorted arrays using binary search approach.
- `q4_merge_median.py`: Median of two sorted arrays using merge approach.
- `q_56_list_intersection.py`: Merges overlapping intervals.
- `quickSort.py`: Quick sort implementation.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add more problem solutions covering a wider range of algorithmic challenges.
- Include unit tests for each solution.
- Optimize existing solutions for performance and readability.
- Add detailed usage examples and input/output formats.
- Support additional programming languages.
