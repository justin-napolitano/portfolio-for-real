This repository contains a document titled "FromGattotheWTO" which appears to involve a detailed discussion or analysis related to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The project currently consists primarily of a Word document and a folder named `full-txt` which likely contains supplementary text files or data.

## Features

- Comprehensive document exploring the transition or relationship between GATT and WTO.
- Supplementary textual data or resources stored in the `full-txt` directory.

## Tech Stack

- Microsoft Word document format (`.docx`) for the main content.
- Plain text files or other formats possibly contained within `full-txt`.

## Getting Started

Since this repository primarily contains documentation, no installation or runtime environment is required.

To view the main document:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `FromGattotheWTO.docx` with Microsoft Word or any compatible word processor.

To explore the supplementary files:

1. Navigate to the `full-txt` directory.
2. Open the text files with any text editor.

## Project Structure

```
FromGattotheWTO.docx  # Main document file
full-txt/             # Folder containing additional text files
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Convert the Word document content into Markdown or HTML for better accessibility and version control.
- Add summaries or annotations to the supplementary text files.
- Include metadata or tags to improve searchability.
- Develop scripts or tools to analyze or extract data from the text files if applicable.
- Clarify and document the purpose and scope of the repository for broader understanding.
