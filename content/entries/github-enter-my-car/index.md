A personal project documenting and reflecting on the routine of entering a vehicle, with a focus on optimizing physical comfort and procedural consistency. This repository captures observations and considerations around daily vehicle entry habits.

## Features

- Detailed step-by-step breakdown of the car entry routine
- Identification of physical challenges and ergonomic considerations
- Notes on personal items management within the vehicle
- Initial thoughts on creating a standardized checklist for the routine

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for documentation
- Static content (no code or scripts present)

## Getting Started

This repository contains documentation in Markdown format and does not include executable code.

To view the content locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/enter_my_car.git
```

2. Open `index.md` in any Markdown viewer or text editor.

## Project Structure

```
enter_my_car/
└── index.md       # Main documentation file describing the routine and reflections
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Develop a formal checklist to standardize the car entry routine
- Explore ergonomic improvements to reduce knee strain when entering the car
- Identify and designate storage solutions for personal items (backpack, umbrella, satchel)
- Potentially convert reflections into a more structured format or application
- Add images or diagrams to illustrate ergonomic recommendations
