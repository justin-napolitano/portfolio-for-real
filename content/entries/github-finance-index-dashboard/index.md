Finance Index Dashboard is a Python-based application designed to provide dynamic financial indices and live performance tracking. It integrates data ingestion, signal computation, and index rebalancing with a modern web frontend for visualization.

---

## Features

- ETL pipeline for fetching and processing financial data from multiple sources
- Computation of financial signals including momentum scores and technical indicators
- Dynamic index definitions and automated rebalancing
- REST API built with FastAPI exposing indices and ticker data
- React/Next.js frontend for interactive visualization of indices and holdings
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment and development
- Database schema migrations managed with Alembic
- Audit and auto-fix tools for database health and consistency

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Data Sources:** yfinance, Wikipedia scraping for tickers
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Recharts
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Optional: Set environment variable `FINNHUB_API_KEY` for ETL data enrichment

### Setup and Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/finance-index-dashboard.git
cd finance-index-dashboard

# Start the full stack (DB, backend, ETL job)
docker compose up -d

# To stop the stack
docker compose down

# Run ETL job manually
make tickers-refresh

# Run backend API locally (hot reload)
make bash-backend
# inside container: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Access frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand index definitions beyond default "momentum-10" strategy
- Add more comprehensive signal computations and technical indicators
- Improve frontend UI/UX with richer charts and filtering
- Integrate authentication and user-specific portfolio tracking
- Enhance ETL robustness and add alternative data sources
- Add automated testing and CI/CD pipelines
- Optimize database queries and indexing strategies
