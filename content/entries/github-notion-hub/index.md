Notion Task Hub is a Python-based tool that automates the creation of a task management workspace within Notion. It bootstraps a clean Task Hub setup including a Dashboard page, Projects and Master Tasks databases, and the necessary relations between them.

## Features

- Creates a Dashboard page under a specified parent page in Notion
- Creates two databases: Projects and Master Tasks
- Adds a relation property linking Tasks to Projects
- Seeds example projects and tasks for immediate use
- Runs safely multiple times without duplicating schema

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Notion API (via notion-client Python SDK)
- Docker for containerization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Notion internal integration with access to your workspace
- Integration token (`NOTION_TOKEN`)
- ID of an existing Notion page to serve as the parent (`ROOT_PAGE_ID`)
- Docker installed

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/notion-hub.git
   cd notion-hub
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t notion-task-hub .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file from the example and set your environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set NOTION_TOKEN and ROOT_PAGE_ID
   ```

4. Run the container to bootstrap the Task Hub:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --env-file .env notion-task-hub
   ```

   On success, you will see:

   ```
   ✅ Done. Open your Notion dashboard page to see 'Task Hub'.
   ```

### Notes

- The script checks for existing Dashboard and databases by title and will not duplicate them.
- Linked database views with UI filters/grouping must be configured manually in Notion.

## Project Structure

```
.
├─ Dockerfile
├─ requirements.txt
├─ .env.example
├─ src/
│  └─ bootstrap_notion_task_hub.py
├─ README.md
├─ build.sh
└─ run.sh
```

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the container image
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables
- `src/bootstrap_notion_task_hub.py`: Main Python script to create the Task Hub
- `build.sh` and `run.sh`: Convenience scripts for building and running the Docker container

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add support for creating linked database views with filters and grouping via the API
- Expand seeded example data for more comprehensive templates
- Add CLI flags for customization without rebuilding the container
- Improve error handling and logging
- Support for updating existing schema properties

This project assumes familiarity with Notion API tokens and page IDs, as well as basic Docker usage. It is designed for users who want to quickly set up a task management workspace in Notion programmatically.
