This repository documents the process of assembling an Everyday Carry (EDC) pouch aimed at organizing essential tools for daily practical use. The goal is to create a compact, modular kit that fits inside various bags and addresses common day-to-day needs.

## Features

- Compact and modular EDC pouch design
- Curated list of essential tools and supplies
- Justification and audit of included items
- Visual documentation of the pouch and its contents

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for documentation
- Static assets (images) for visual references
