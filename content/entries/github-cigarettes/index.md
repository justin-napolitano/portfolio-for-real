A personal reflective journal repository capturing moments and thoughts around lifestyle and anxiety, centered on the theme of smoking cigarettes. This repository uses markdown files to document introspective narratives and personal experiences.

## Features

- Personal storytelling in markdown format
- Focus on lifestyle, anxiety, and introspection
- Simple, text-based content for easy reading and editing

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for content formatting
- Static markdown files, no specific programming language or framework

## Getting Started

Since this repository consists entirely of markdown content, no build or runtime environment is required. To get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/cigarettes.git
cd cigarettes
# Open index.md in your preferred markdown viewer or editor
```

## Project Structure

```
/index.md         # Main markdown file containing the personal narrative
/images/          # (Assumed) folder for images referenced in markdown
README.md         # This file
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add more entries or chapters to expand the personal journal
- Include images or multimedia content to enrich storytelling
- Possibly convert markdown files into a static site or blog
- Tagging and categorization of posts for better navigation
