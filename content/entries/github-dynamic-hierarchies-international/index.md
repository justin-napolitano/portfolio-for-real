This repository contains research and documentation related to the dynamics of hierarchies within international institutions. The primary artifact is a detailed document exploring theoretical and empirical aspects of hierarchical structures in global governance.

## Features

- Comprehensive research document on dynamic hierarchies in international institutions
- Full text data or supplementary materials (assumed based on file naming)

## Tech Stack

- No executable code or software components detected
- Primary content is a Microsoft Word document (.docx)

## Getting Started

This repository currently hosts research materials rather than software. To access the primary content:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `DynamicHierarchiesInInternationalInstitutions.docx` using Microsoft Word or a compatible word processor.

No installation or runtime commands are applicable.

## Project Structure

```
/DynamicHierarchiesInInternationalInstitutions.docx  # Main research document
/full-txt/                                            # Presumed supplementary text data or related files
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Consider converting the document to more accessible formats (PDF, Markdown)
- Extract and structure data for computational analysis
- Develop accompanying code or tools to model or simulate hierarchical dynamics
- Add a summary or abstract to the repository for easier understanding
