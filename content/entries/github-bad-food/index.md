A personal reflection project by Justin Napolitano focused on identifying and letting go of "bad food" habits. This repository contains markdown-based insights and categorizations around food choices that impact health, dental well-being, and lifestyle.

## Features

- Personal reflections on unhealthy food habits
- Categorization of "bad food" based on health, dental impact, and other criteria
- Insight into lifestyle changes and moderation

## Tech Stack

- Markdown files for content
- No programming language or framework used

## Getting Started

Since this repository contains markdown content only, you can view it directly on GitHub or clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/bad-food.git
cd bad-food
# Open index.md in your favorite markdown viewer or editor
```

## Project Structure

```
/index.md    # Main content file containing the reflections and notes
/images/     # (Assumed) folder for images referenced in the markdown
README.md    # This file
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand on the "Meat" section and other categories
- Add more detailed dietary guidelines or personal goals
- Possibly convert reflections into a blog or website for easier reading
- Include images and media to enrich the content
