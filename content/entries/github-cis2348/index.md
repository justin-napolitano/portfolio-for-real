This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python programming assignments and projects completed for the CIS2348 course in Fall 2022. It demonstrates foundational programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and algorithm implementations across multiple homework assignments and a final project.

## Features

- Solutions to homework assignments (HW1 to HW4) covering topics such as basic input/output, control flow, data structures, sorting algorithms, file handling, and exception management.
- Final project focused on CSV file processing, data merging, and integration.
- Examples of object-oriented programming with classes and methods.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/CIS2348.git
   cd CIS2348
   ```

### Running Code

- Navigate to the desired homework folder (e.g., `HW1`, `HW2`, etc.).
- Run Python scripts using the command:
  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
- Some scripts require input files (e.g., `inputDates.txt`, `ManufacturerList.csv`), ensure these files are present in the working directory.

## Project Structure

```
CIS2348/
├── FinalProjectPart1/       # Final project code involving CSV data processing
├── HW1/                    # Homework 1 assignments
├── HW2/                    # Homework 2 assignments
├── HW3/                    # Homework 3 assignments
├── HW4/                    # Homework 4 assignments
└── README.md               # This readme file
```

- Each homework folder contains Python scripts that solve specific problems or labs.
- The final project folder contains code for a larger assignment involving data integration from multiple CSV files.

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add detailed documentation and comments to all scripts for better clarity.
- Include input sample files and expected outputs for easier testing.
- Implement automated testing for homework assignments.
- Expand the final project with more robust data validation and error handling.
