Radio Collector is a minimal, ad-free web application for discovering and playing public internet radio streams. It leverages the community-run Radio Browser directory and runs as a single Docker container for easy deployment.

---

## Features

- Search stations by name, genre, or country
- Favorites stored locally in the browser
- Clean, privacy-focused UI with no tracking or ads
- Single container deployment combining Node.js backend and React frontend
- Proxy for Radio Browser API to avoid CORS issues
- Healthcheck endpoint for container monitoring

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, http-proxy-middleware, compression, helmet, morgan
- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Proxying:** Configurable reverse proxy support (Traefik, Caddy, Nginx)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js >= 18 (for local development)

### Build and Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t radio-collector .
docker run -d --name radio-collector -p 8080:8080 radio-collector
# Access the app at http://localhost:8080
```

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Development

1. Install dependencies in `web` folder:

```bash
cd web
npm install
```

2. Run frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```

---

## Configuration

- `PORT`: Port the server listens on (default `8080`)
- `RADIO_BROWSER_BASE`: Base URL for Radio Browser API mirror (default `https://de1.api.radio-browser.info`)

---

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add user authentication for syncing favorites across devices
- Support for additional audio codecs and better browser compatibility
- Improve UI/UX with more filters and station metadata
- Add HTTPS support out of the box with automatic certificate management
- Enhance healthchecks and monitoring integration
- Container image size optimization

---

## Notes

- The app does not remove audio ads injected by radio stations.
- Some streams may not play due to browser codec or CORS restrictions.
- The backend proxies only the Radio Browser API; audio streams are played directly from their sources.
