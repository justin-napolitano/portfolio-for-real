A data-focused blog platform built with Gatsby, designed to integrate Markdown and HTML content for publishing detailed data analyses and research posts.

---

## Features

- Static site generation using Gatsby with React
- Support for Markdown and HTML content
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Integration with various Gatsby plugins for image optimization, offline support, and smooth scrolling
- Custom GraphQL queries to generate pages from content
- Python build automation script for dependency management and site building

## Tech Stack

- Gatsby (React-based static site generator)
- React 17
- GraphQL for data querying
- Python for build automation
- GeoPandas, Folium, and other Python libraries for geospatial data analysis (in blog content)
- PrismJS for syntax highlighting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3 (for build automation script)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/data-blog.git
cd data-blog
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run develop
# or
# yarn develop
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000` to view the site.

### Building the Site

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

Serve the production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
# yarn serve
```

### Python Build Script

A Python script (`python-build.py`) automates cleaning, building, committing, and pushing the Gatsby site.

Run the script:

```bash
python python-build.py
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add comprehensive documentation and metadata for blog posts
- Implement testing for React components and GraphQL queries
- Enhance Python build script with error handling and logging
- Add support for additional data visualization components
- Integrate continuous deployment pipeline
- Expand content types and support for interactive notebooks
