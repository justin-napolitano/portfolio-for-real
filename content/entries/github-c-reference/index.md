A collection of fundamental C algorithms demonstrating classic sorting, searching, and mathematical computations. This repository serves as a practical reference for common algorithm implementations in C.

## Features

- Implementations of various sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort.
- Mathematical algorithms including Fibonacci sequence, factorial, and prime checking.
- Utility programs such as palindrome checking and CSV parsing.
- Simple, straightforward C code suitable for learning and reference.

## Tech Stack

- Language: C
- No external dependencies; standard C libraries used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., gcc)

### Build and Run

To compile and run any program, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

Replace `filename.c` with the desired source file (e.g., `selection.c`).

## Project Structure

- `40_digit_interger.c`: Implementation related to handling large integers (assumed).
- Sorting algorithms:
  - `selection.c`
  - `bubble.c`
  - `mergeSort.c`
  - `quicksort.c`
  - `bucket.c`
  - `bucketSort.c`
  - `counting.c`
  - `radix.c`
  - `insertion.c`
  - `binary_trie_sorting.c`
- Mathematical algorithms:
  - `factorial.c`
  - `fibonacci.c`
  - `primeCheck.c`
- Utility:
  - `palindrome.c`
  - `csv.c`
  - `search.c`
- Documentation:
  - `README.md`

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Add more algorithms covering graph theory, dynamic programming, and data structures.
- Include detailed comments and documentation for each algorithm.
- Provide test cases and benchmarking scripts.
- Refactor code to improve modularity and reusability.
- Add Makefile or build scripts for easier compilation.
- Consider porting to other languages or providing bindings.
