A collection of data analysis projects and technical interview solutions by Justin Napolitano, primarily using Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts interfacing with Google Cloud services such as BigQuery and Bigtable.

## Features

- SQL queries and Python scripts for analyzing NYC taxi trip data using BigQuery.
- Weather data collection and streaming solutions using APIs and Google Cloud Bigtable.
- Jupyter Book structured technical interview answers and cost of living models.
- Automated build pipeline for Jupyter Book documentation.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Cloud BigQuery and Bigtable
- Java (sample Bigtable external query)
- Jupyter Book for documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- Google Cloud SDK configured with appropriate credentials
- `pip` for Python package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/pmc-submission.git
cd pmc-submission
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Google Cloud credentials environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/creds.json"
```

### Running

- To run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

- To run test queries against BigQuery, explore `test.py`.

- To build the Jupyter Book documentation:

```bash
python python_build.py
```

```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Complete and clean up Java and Python BigQuery client code.
- Consolidate or remove duplicate/misplaced files like `query_gooogle.json`.
- Expand automated testing and CI/CD for data pipelines.
- Enhance documentation with more detailed usage examples.
- Integrate data pipeline automation for weather and taxi data ingestion.
- Improve error handling and logging in scripts.
